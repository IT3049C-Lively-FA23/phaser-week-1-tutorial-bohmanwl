## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 15

## Self-Reflection:
There is some sort of error on startup of the game so it just shows a black screen. Based on the rubric thats an automatic 5 points off. I started the assignment on wednesday with no issues. I had US Army drill this weekend from Thursday to Sunday in Michigan which ate up a lot of my time for the week. I started having issued around video 4 or 5 with the game loading up. I tried to fix it for about an hour with no success, so i decided to cut my losses and just continue the video tutorials to maximize my points.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 3-4 hours
